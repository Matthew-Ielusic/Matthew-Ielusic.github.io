<p>Minecraft has a large community of "modders," people who create and publish unofficial add-ons.  In my junior year of high school I decided to join this community, and have been working on an add-on of my own ever since.</p>

<h5>
<a id="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h5>

<p>My work is themed around adding both interesting systems for users to interact with, and cool tools to use.</p>

<a id="history" class="anchor" href="#history" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>History</h6>

<p>As initially envisioned, this was mean to complement a different add-on, but I soon set my sights higher.  I developed my core philosophy and starting goals, in late 2013 I finished the last of them -- but by that point, had thought up new ones. Unfortunately, around then Minecraft's owners decided to start rewriting large parts of its code base every few months, thus forcing add-on developers to continually rewrite their own code at a similar pace. My progress has stalled greatly since then.</p>
