In my junior year of high school I decided to join this community, and have been working on an add-on of my own ever since.\r\n\r\n#####Philosophy\r\nMy work is themed around adding both interesting systems for users to interact with, and cool tools to use.\r\n######History\r\nAs initially envisioned, this was mean to complement a different add-on, but I soon set my sights higher.  I developed my core philosophy and starting goals, in late 2013 I finished the last of them -- but by that point, had thought up new ones. Unfortunately, around then Minecraft's owners decided to start rewriting large parts of its code base every few months, thus forcing add-on developers to continually rewrite their own code at a similar pace. My progress has stalled greatly since then.\r\n######Current state\r\nMy github repository can be found at https://github.com/Matthew-Ielusic/Minecraft-Gas-Systems-.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
