I've worked in Java and Haskell, and know a bit of C.  I've written an [add-on of sorts](http://matthew-ielusic.github.io/Minecraft-Gas-Systems-/) for the game Minecraft.  My resume can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Matthew-Ielusic/Matthew-Ielusic.github.io/blob/master/Resume.pdf).\r\n\r\n### My Projects\r\nIndependently I've written I've written [modification, or \"mod\"](http://matthew-ielusic.github.io/Minecraft-Gas-Systems-/) for the game Minecraft and a [data-mining tool](http://matthew-ielusic.github.io/WorldofTanks-DataMining-/) for players of World of Tanks.  As part of my schoolwork I've written a [text adventure game](http://matthew-ielusic.github.io/Small-Text-Adventure).  \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Contact\r\nI can be emailed at mielusic3@gatech.edu, and I have a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/MIelusic).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
